# Laser Defense

This is a small AR project developed for the Interacrive Graphical Systems course in the Master if Informathics Engeneering on the UPC school.

This is a small AR tower defense game where enemies will spawn and try to destoy your bases. Your bases will have towers defending them: these towers emit lasers that destroy the enemies. However, the towers can only fire the lasers in fixed directions, so in order to redirect the lasers towards the enemies one must use mirrors that are controlled by physical cards.
